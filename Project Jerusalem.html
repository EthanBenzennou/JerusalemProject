    <h1><span id="heading1">Jerusalem Attractions</span></h1>
    <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Jerusalem</strong> is the religious and historical epicenter of the world.
        A surreal and vibrant city, holy to Jews, Muslims, and Christians - over one-third of all the people on the
        earth.
        Jerusalem is as unique as she is special.
        Beyond her religious and historic significance, Jerusalem is the capital of modern-day Israel and an advanced,
        dynamic city.
        Jerusalem has to be seen to be believed.
        Exploring Jerusalem solo is fantastic, and if it's your first time visiting this glorious place, a tour of
        Jerusalem is a must.
        With so much to see and know, having an experienced guide with you is indispensable and worth every penny.

        <strong>Since the British Mandate for Palestine was expiring,</strong> the 1947 UN Partition Plan recommended "the creation of a
        special international regime in the City of Jerusalem, constituting it as a corpus separatum under the
        administration of the UN.
        The international regime (which also included the city of Bethlehem) was to remain in force for a period of ten
        years, whereupon a referendum was to be held in which the residents were to decide the future regime of their
        city.
        However, this plan was not implemented, as the 1948 war erupted, while the British withdrew from Palestine and
        Israel declared its independence.

        In contradiction to the Partition Plan, which envisioned a city separated from the Arab state and the Jewish
        state, Israel took control of the area which later would become West Jerusalem, along with major parts of the
        Arab territory allotted to the future Arab State; Jordan took control of East Jerusalem, along with the West
        Bank.
        The war led to displacement of Arab and Jewish populations in the city. The 1,500 residents of the Jewish
        Quarter of the Old City were expelled and a few hundred taken prisoner when the Arab Legion captured the quarter
        on 28 May.
        Arab residents of Katamon, Talbiya, and the German Colony were driven from their homes. By the time of the
        armistice that ended active fighting, Israel had control of 12 of Jerusalem's 15 Arab residential quarters.
        An estimated minimum of 30,000 people had become refugees.

        The war of 1948 resulted in the division of Jerusalem, so that the old walled city lay entirely on the Jordanian
        side of the line.
        A no-man's land between East and West Jerusalem came into being in November 1948: Moshe Dayan, commander of the
        Israeli forces in Jerusalem, met with his Jordanian counterpart Abdullah el-Tell in a deserted house in
        Jerusalem's Musrara neighborhood and marked out their respective positions: Israel's position in red and
        Jordan's in green.
        This rough map, which was not meant as an official one, became the final line in the 1949 Armistice Agreements,
        which divided the city and left Mount Scopus as an Israeli exclave inside East Jerusalem.
        Barbed wire and concrete barriers ran down the center of the city, passing close by Jaffa Gate on the western
        side of the old walled city, and a crossing point was established at Mandelbaum Gate slightly to the north of
        the old walled city. Military skirmishes frequently threatened the ceasefire. <br><br>

        <strong>After the establishment of the state of Israel,</strong> Jerusalem was declared its capital city.
        Jordan formally annexed East Jerusalem in 1950, subjecting it to Jordanian law, and in 1953 declared it the
        "second capital" of Jordan.
        Only the United Kingdom and Pakistan formally recognized such annexation, which, in regard to Jerusalem, was on
        a de facto basis. Some scholars argue that the view that Pakistan recognized Jordan's annexation is dubious.
        After 1948, since the old walled city in its entirety was to the east of the armistice line, Jordan was able to
        take control of all the holy places therein.
        While Muslim holy sites were maintained and renovated, contrary to the terms of the armistice agreement, Jews
        were denied access to Jewish holy sites, many of which were destroyed or desecrated.
        Jordan allowed only very limited access to Christian holy sites, and restrictions were imposed on the Christian
        population that led many to leave the city.
        Of the 58 synagogues in the Old City, half were either razed or converted to stables and hen-houses over the
        course of the next 19 years, including the Hurva and the Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue.
        The 3,000-year-old Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery was desecrated, with gravestones used to build roads,
        latrines and Jordanian army fortifications. 38,000 graves in the Jewish Cemetery were destroyed, and Jews were
        forbidden from being buried there.
        The Western Wall was transformed into an exclusively Muslim holy site associated with al-Buraq.
        Israeli authorities neglected to protect the tombs in the Muslim Mamilla Cemetery in West Jerusalem, which
        contains the remains of figures from the early Islamic period, facilitating the creation of a parking lot and
        public lavatories in
        Many other historic and religiously significant buildings were demolished and replaced by modern structures
        during the Jordanian occupation.
        During this period, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque underwent major renovations.

        During the 1948 war, the Jewish residents of Eastern Jerusalem were expelled by Jordan's Arab Legion. Jordan
        allowed Arab Palestinian refugees from the war to settle in the vacated Jewish Quarter, which became known as
        Harat al-Sharaf.
        In 1966 the Jordanian authorities relocated 500 of them to the Shua'fat refugee camp as part of plans to turn
        the Jewish quarter into a public park.
